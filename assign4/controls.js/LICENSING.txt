LICENSING
=========

The Controls.js is available in two licensing options: 

commercial and open source license. 

You may use Controls.js free of charge under the open source license (GPLv3 license) 
but you must comply with the terms of the license agreement, which requires you to 
distribute your application also under open source license and that you release source 
code of application to the general public.

Alternatively, you can purchase a commercial license where releasing of the application's 
source code is not required.
