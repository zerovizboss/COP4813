            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>
                I've had some exposure to building websites before, however, they were all based on front-end applications or a Content Management System like DNN(Dot Net Nuke), Joomla!, Wordpress.  I learned how the
                basic structure of html is combined with a style sheet (CSS file) as well as how to be creative with my page.  It takes a bit of graphic arts and English grammar, not to mention some basic comprehension
                of coding in a hypertext language.  In this assignment I learned the difference between using a &lt;table&gt; tag for a navigation bar versus using a list of links in a vertical bar.
                I learned how to play with the links to get them to change shape, color and other attributes to make them easier to navigate.

            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>
                This assignment involves creating an interactive for an audience of our choice.  We are tasked with utilizing several form controls
                that are common among event-driven applications.  During this phase of learning Javascript, we are simply interacting with embedded
                functions that serve to work on the fly without using a backend database or a built-in API library of javascript functions.
            </p>
            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>
                I've learned that the &lt;head&gt; tag is utilized for embedding javascript (js) functions, which are run by the CPU during the loading
                phase.  I also learned that js is an interpreted language, meaning most data types are predefined and don't have to be compiled before
                being executed.  The emphasis on placement of js is not restricted to the body, however, the importance of knowing why certain js code
                is placed in the &lt;head&gt; tag versus the &lt;body&gt; tag is crucial.
            </p>
            <p>
                Forms are easy to work with, but form design takes some getting used to.  There are several business and personal uses for form interaction
                and I found this to be the most difficult.  Once I got an idea of what to use, the coding went quickly because js follows the same basic
                programming principles as most Object Oriented languages like Java and C# with the added advantage/disadvantage that it doesn't need to be
                compiled.
            </p>

            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>
                Assignment 3 introduces the use of an external javascript file.  In this case I created a library of basic statistical calculations.
                Simply enter up to 9 numbers and select the Statistics button to get a summary of the resultant  calculations.
            </p>
            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>
                instead of using the &lt;head&gt; tag for embedding javascript (js) functions, we could easily link to an external js file, which is
                beneficial when you have a large website with multiple interactions.  It helps for readability of code and allows each method to be loaded 
                when it's called rather than each time the landing page is loaded.

                    <li>Create interactive statistical functions</li>
                    <li>Build on what we've already learned with form interactions with our own Statistics API library</li>

            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>
                In this exercise I'm learning HTML5 using the &lt;canvas&gt; tag in order to draw shapes, include graphs, sounds, animations.
            </p>
            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>
                Although I had attempted to build on what we've learned, I tried using an external javascript file with an external stylesheet.
                Unfortunately, all my attempts to animate my drawings failed...miserably.  Through all the websites I referenced, all gave examples
                with embedded js code and loaded the functions using the window.onload() event but none gave examples on loading functions from an
                external js file.  I've come to the conclusion that I will need to run these in php as server-side functions rather than trying to
                run them as client-side functions, else the functions would need to be embedded to be loaded correctly.  I still believe it is possible
                to call these functions using embedded code and have the external javascript library load the functions on an as needed basis.

            <h2>DESCRIPTION</h2>
            <p>
                Create a stock portfolio website with our first PHP server-side interactive mySQL database.  
            </p>
            <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
            <p>
                There was a lot going on with this assignment.  I learned the importance of framework design prior to creation.  As this 
                assignment leads onto more and more complex ones, I am able to see how they are being put together...a bit slow and archaic
                considering after moving out of the classroom environment, companies primarily use pre-defined API's.  Furthermore, as I developed
                my flow control, it became much easier to design my concept...although I am still finding code errors, probably due to lack of experience
                with unfamiliar commands.<br>
                Another important feature was the use of arrays() with pre-defined data.  I'm pretty familiar with database design, manipulation and management,
                so I found myself wanting to setup connection strings, schemas and the database itself.  Most of the tech support calls I've handled involve setup issues with
                new server configurations.
