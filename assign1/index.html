            <h3>A Brief History in my past</h3>
            <p>
                This page is a brief history of "Who am I" in our mosaic society of interactivity.  My swashbuckling days stared when I was 15
                and I've never stopped serving this country.  I'm very patriotic and enjoyed my military career while it lasted.  My one regret
                is not having stayed in, although I now know it wouldn't have mattered due to the military cutbacks shortly after I left in 1993.
                My ultimate goal is not to brag, but to share my stories so I can shed some color in your life and maybe, just maybe I'll have a positive influence in your realm
            </p>
            <p>
                Stationed in Mayport NS, my first assignement was to the <em>USS Tattnall</em>, which was an old WWII steam Destroyer and I had the honor of
                decommissioning after <b>Desert Shield</b>.  Upon it's ceremonial burial, I requested a 2nd tour to <b>Desert Storm</b> on board the <em>USS John L. Hall</em>.
                I suppose I take it for granted that I traveled the world and moored up in many a port, however, the questions I've been asked over the years
                has softened me, not to mention a little influence from my firstborn, and helped me view my service in a new light.  It was my voyage with a 
                team of highly trained, highly focused and very professional sailors.  We were very good at combat, but it doesn't change the fact that war is
                ugly.
            </p>
            <center><h2><em>You don't go looking for war, but you must always be vigilant and prepared for it's wrath.</em></h2></center>
            <center><h3>What does freedom mean?</h3></center>
            <p>
                I was asked this seemingly innocent question, however, I was in a USSR controlled country during the Russian Revolution when Vladimir Putin had taken control of the new regime.
                Protests and riots were everywhere, we were in an extremely tense, highly sensitive and volatile situation.  <i>Out with the old and in with the new</i>...some of you may recall the 60's here in America...that might be a close
                comparison.  Anyhow, I was talking to a group of young students and their apparent leader had asked me that question...with all seriousness...as if 
                my life had depended on my answer.  The difficulty came because I realized that I was speaking to a group who'd never experienced freedom in their entire life.
                The only principles they had experienced were the iron-fist, Stalinistic rule that had been in existence for decades.
            </p>
            <p>
                I ended up explaining that the sky is the limit.  With freedom, you're empowered with the decisions in your life and where to take it, but
                it comes at the cost of dealing with your own consequences if things don't work out the way you expected.  The government isn't going to be there to pick up the
                pieces and dust you off or kiss your wounds...<em>Although that doesn't seem to be the case anymore in America.</em>
            
                The most famous cliche "Jack of all trades, master of none" would seem to fit.
                Not quite, but you never truly master something because you're always learning.  I have several trades that I can honestly say I'm an expert in,
                however, that doesn't mean I've mastered them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Journey I've taken is no secret and I only have a couple of regrets.  I'm learning more and more the importance of sharing my experiences so it helps others.
                I have a very simple philosophical viewpoint...deal with life head on, as fast as it comes at you, but <strong><em>never...never...never quit</em></strong>.
                This doesn't mean I haven't changed directions or altered my course heading, but I am persistent to say the least.
            
                Several years ago, my life was perfect...had the perfect, Christian marriage, a newborn daughter, immaculate finances, a great career...so what happened?  
                Then, without warning, it comes down, like an avalanche...most wouldn't have survived.  I didn't see the downfall until the dust settled, nearly 10 years later.
                I simply don't know how to quit...anything...which is both a blessing and a curse.
            </p>
            <p>
                I left Merrill Lynch because it was up for sale and I decided to attend Dive School, which I graduated and moved back to Jax where my first contract kicked off my business.
                My ex-wife was a stay at home mom who started perusing the apartment complex neighborhood in her free time...boredom is the devils workshop.
                I had started my new business, and before you know it I was divorced and received full custody of my 3 year old daughter. $20,000+ in court costs and still counting.
            
                Ironic, of all the things that could have ended my life, the one thing I had served my country for was the American dream.  Here I'd fought, lived,
                and nearly died for...now I've run out of steam for that dream...but not due to a war overseas in some god-forsaken country (like Vietnam), but right here in our own backyard!
                <em>Domestic Warfare</em>
            </p>
            <h3>PRESENT</h3>
            <p>
                I truly have lived a full life and I'm only in my early 40's...I'm in uncharted waters with a new heading...going to school, again!...I feel like my life is one massive reboot, not sure if
                the gods of our government simply want to expunge my efforts or if fate just seems to follow me around, but you can <u>bet your ass that I will <b>never</b> bow down nor give up!</u>
            
                My present wife and I met through our kids daycare when I was a single father.  I was running a very successfull Commercial Diving Business called Zeroviz (you really can't see anything in the St. Johns River)
                I was not in any hurry to get re-married, as a matter-of-fact, I didn't meet her for over a year after my divorce...didn't date...didn't focus on anything else but my 3 year old daughter and my career.
                We had ups and downs as do most couples, we had even stopped dating for over a year after we'd been dating for about 3 years.  It's tough to try to date someone when you are both dealing with your own obstacles
                of life at the same time...it's hard to be supportive of one another.
            
                We have now been married for about 5 years, but been together for about 12.  We have a nice home with a pool.  Oh and I nearly forgot the strangest part...our daughters are only
                3 months apart.  I usually lead with that statement and it creates a lot of confused looks when I say I have 2 daughters 3 months apart.  We are both going to school now and try to impress on our kids the importance
                of getting an education while your young and don't have to deal with life's complications.
            </p>
            <h3>FUTURE</h3>
            <p>
                The future is unfolding before my eyes...whom to serve?...whom to trust?...feels like I'm living some kind of novel, but I can assure you my life has been
                very real.  My plans are tentative, my goals are my own...I don't trust government agencies (not just our own), and I have a hard time taking pride in my own country after all
                the horsepucky I've waded through.
